# sai-live-transcribe
This project automates the transcription of speech to text locally in computer so that we need not pay for software like otter

# System Design and Architecture

## High-Level Components

1. **Frontend (React + TypeScript)**
   - User Interface
   - Audio Capture
   - WebSocket Client

2. **Backend (Python + FastAPI)**
   - WebSocket Server
   - Audio Processing
   - Speech Recognition Model
   - API Endpoints

3. **Speech Recognition Model (Whisper)**
   - Local model for offline transcription

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the React frontend to start/stop transcription
2. Frontend captures audio from the user's microphone
3. Audio data is sent to the backend via WebSocket
4. Backend processes the audio and passes it to the Whisper model
5. Whisper model performs speech recognition
6. Transcription results are sent back to the frontend via WebSocket
7. Frontend displays the transcription in real-time

## Key Technologies

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Web Audio API
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, WebSockets
- Speech Recognition: OpenAI's Whisper (local implementation)
- Development: Node.js, npm/yarn

## Security and Privacy Considerations

- All processing occurs locally
- No data leaves the user's computer
- No internet connection required for core functionality

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize audio processing for low latency
- Use efficient data structures for real-time updates
- Implement proper error handling and graceful degradation
